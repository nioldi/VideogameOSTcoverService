# VideogameOSTcoverService
The Retro Videogame Fanclub of Vienna has approached you to contribute to
the Open Data sources on the internet. They want to establish a service that allows
users to search for a videogame and receive a list of soundtrack covers for said
game in the JSON format to be used in own applications.
